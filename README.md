# PATTERN

This repository is used to store the publicly available code covered in Nature Communications article 'Photoacoustic Tomography with Temporal Encoding Reconstruction (PATTERN) for Cross-Modal Individual Analysis of the Whole Brain'

We disclose here the code used to process photoacoustic signal artefacts, data hand-labeled by human experts, and pre-trained models for mouse HP/AI/BLA.We also make public the code for a spatial transcriptomics analysis process that incorporates PATTERN. You can find the corresponding contents in the two subfolders.

For the code of the PATTERN-based sampling phase and the code of the 3D reconstruction process, we are happy to share with interested readers the source code that we have written based on matlab. Unfortunately, these are complex and voluminous, and are currently stored in the lab servers, making it difficult to upload them directly to github.
If any of our readers are interested, please feel free to contact us directly by e-mail using the author information in the article.
